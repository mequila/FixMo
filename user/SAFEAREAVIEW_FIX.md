# Header SafeAreaView Fix - serviceprovider.tsx

## Issue
The header was appearing behind/overlapping with the status bar (notification bar) on the device.

## Root Cause
The `SafeAreaView` component was incorrectly wrapping only the content inside the `ScrollView`, causing the header to be rendered without proper top padding for the status bar.

## Solution
Restructured the component layout to properly handle the status bar area:

### Before (Incorrect):
```tsx
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  <ScrollView>
    <SafeAreaView>
      {/* Header */}
      <View>...</View>
      {/* Content */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  </ScrollView>
</View>
```

### After (Correct):
```tsx
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 0, backgroundColor: '#e7ecec' }} />
  <ScrollView>
    {/* Header */}
    <View>...</View>
    {/* Content */}
  </ScrollView>
</View>
```

## Changes Made

1. **Moved SafeAreaView outside ScrollView**: 
   - Added `<SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 0, backgroundColor: '#e7ecec' }} />` at the top level
   - This creates the proper top padding/margin for the status bar

2. **Removed old SafeAreaView wrapper**:
   - Removed the `<SafeAreaView style={homeStyles.safeArea}>` that was wrapping the content
   - Removed the corresponding `</SafeAreaView>` closing tag

3. **Set proper background color**:
   - Used `backgroundColor: '#e7ecec'` to match the header color
   - This ensures seamless appearance under the status bar

## Result
- ✅ Header now appears below the status bar
- ✅ Proper spacing at the top of the screen
- ✅ Status bar area has matching background color
- ✅ No content overlap with system UI

## Technical Details

### Why `flex: 0`?
Setting `flex: 0` on the SafeAreaView ensures it only takes up the minimum space needed for the status bar padding, rather than expanding to fill available space.

### SafeAreaView Positioning
- The SafeAreaView at the top handles only the status bar inset
- The ScrollView and its content flow naturally below it
- This pattern is commonly used in React Native apps for proper status bar handling

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the service provider list screen
2. Check that the header with back button appears below the status bar
3. Verify the background color matches seamlessly
4. Test on different devices (notched and non-notched)

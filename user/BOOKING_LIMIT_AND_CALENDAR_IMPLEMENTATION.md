## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of two key features:
1. **Booking Limit System**: Restricts customers to a maximum of 3 scheduled appointments at any time
2. **15-Day Calendar Restriction**: Limits booking window to only 15 days from the current date

## Implementation Date
October 3, 2025

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. 15-Day Calendar Restriction

#### Location: `app/serviceprovider.tsx`
- **Date Picker Restrictions**:
  - `minimumDate`: Set to current date (prevents past date selection)
  - `maximumDate`: Set to current date + 15 days
  - Added informational message: "ðŸ“… You can book appointments up to 15 days in advance"

**Example**: If today is October 3, 2025:
- Minimum selectable date: October 3, 2025
- Maximum selectable date: October 18, 2025 (today + 15 days)

#### Location: `app/profile_serviceprovider.tsx`
- **Pre-Booking Date Validation** in `handleBookNowPress()`:
  - Validates selected date is not in the past
  - Validates selected date is within 15 days from today
  - Shows appropriate error messages if validation fails

**Error Messages**:
- Past date: "Cannot book appointments in the past. Please select a date from today onwards."
- Date too far: "You can only book appointments up to 15 days in advance. The selected date is beyond this limit."

### 2. Booking Limit System (3 Scheduled Appointments Max)

#### API Integration
**Endpoint**: `GET /auth/customer-booking-availability`
- Checks how many scheduled appointments the customer currently has
- Returns availability status, scheduled count, and max allowed

**Scheduled Statuses** (count toward limit):
- Pending
- Accepted
- Approved
- Confirmed

**Non-Scheduled Statuses** (don't count toward limit):
- In Progress
- On The Way
- Completed
- Cancelled
- Finished

#### Implementation in `app/profile_serviceprovider.tsx`

##### New State Variables
```typescript
const [bookingAvailability, setBookingAvailability] = useState<{
  canBook: boolean;
  scheduledCount: number;
  maxAllowed: number;
  availableSlots: number;
  message: string;
} | null>(null);
```

##### New Functions

**1. `checkBookingAvailability()`**
- Fetches customer's booking availability from backend
- Called on component mount and after successful booking
- Updates `bookingAvailability` state with latest data

**2. Updated `handleBookNowPress()`**
- Added booking limit validation before showing booking modal
- Checks `bookingAvailability.canBook` flag
- Shows error alert if limit reached with details:
  - Current scheduled count
  - Maximum allowed
  - Instructions to wait for completion/cancellation

**3. Updated `handleBookingConfirmation()`**
- Enhanced error handling for booking limit errors (400 status)
- Refreshes booking availability after successful booking
- Shows specific error message for limit-reached scenarios
- Offers navigation to bookings page to view scheduled appointments

##### Visual Indicators

**Booking Availability Status Box**:
- Displayed in Booking Summary section
- Shows available slots (e.g., "Available Slots: 2/3")
- Color-coded:
  - Green background (`#e8f5e9`) with checkmark icon when slots available
  - Red background (`#ffebee`) with alert icon when limit reached
- Includes helpful message:
  - "You can book X more appointment(s)" when available
  - "Complete or cancel an appointment to book more" when limit reached

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: User has available slots (e.g., 1/3 scheduled)
1. User navigates to service provider profile
2. **Booking Summary** shows: "Available Slots: 2/3" (green)
3. User selects a date (restricted to 15 days max)
4. User clicks "Book Now"
5. System validates:
   - âœ… User is verified
   - âœ… Date is within 15 days
   - âœ… Has available booking slots (2 remaining)
6. Booking modal appears
7. User confirms booking
8. Backend creates appointment
9. Booking availability refreshes automatically
10. Success message with appointment ID
11. User redirected to bookings page

### Scenario 2: User has reached limit (3/3 scheduled)
1. User navigates to service provider profile
2. **Booking Summary** shows: "Booking Limit Reached (3/3)" (red)
3. User selects a date
4. User clicks "Book Now"
5. System immediately shows alert:
   - "Booking Limit Reached"
   - "You have reached the maximum of 3 scheduled appointments"
   - "Please wait for one of your appointments to be completed, cancelled, or in-progress"
6. User cannot proceed with booking
7. Must complete/cancel existing appointment first

### Scenario 3: User selects date beyond 15 days
1. User navigates to service provider profile
2. User clicks date picker
3. Date picker only shows dates from today to today + 15 days
4. User cannot select dates beyond this range
5. If somehow a date beyond range is set, validation catches it:
   - "Date Too Far Ahead"
   - Shows allowed date range
   - User must select valid date

## Backend Integration

### Request to Create Appointment

  "service_id": 789,
  ...
}
```

### Possible Responses

```

**Booking Limit Error (400)**:
